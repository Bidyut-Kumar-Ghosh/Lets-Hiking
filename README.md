# Lets-Hiking

My Learning Journey: Building "Let's Hiking" with HTML, CSS & JavaScript

As I began learning web development, I focused on the core front-end technologies: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. To apply what I was learning, I created a simple website project called "Let's Hiking", centered around my interest in hiking and the outdoors.

Through this project, I learned how to structure web pages using HTML, style them with CSS, and add basic interactivity with JavaScript. I built a clean layout with a homepage, hiking tips, and destination sections. I also practiced using responsive design to make the website look good on different screen sizes.

Creating "Let's Hiking" helped me understand the workflow of building a complete website from scratch. I explored how to use colors, fonts, images, and layout techniques to create a nature-inspired look and feel. With JavaScript, I added small features like dropdown menus and simple animations to make the site more engaging.

Overall, this project was a big step in my learning journey and gave me a hands-on experience in turning code into a real, usable website.
